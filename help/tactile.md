# Tactile

Tactile is a tool for tiling windows on larger displays. It's not a tiling windows manager, like i3 or Hyprland,
so it works alongside the regular Ubuntu Gnome window system that anyone coming from Windows or Mac would be 
familiar with. By default, Omakub has configured it with 6 slots, using one main column, and two wings. This is
a great setup for having your editor in the center, flanked by docs and browser and AI helpers and what else.

You don't need or probably even want to use this when using a smaller laptop, like a Framework 13. On a screen 
like that, you're better off either using your applications full-screen and switching between workspaces, or 
just using the two-way default Gnome tiling. Super+<arrow left> and Super+<arrow right> controls the default 
Gnome window tiler, putting the active application on either the left or the right. Super+<arrow up> will 
maximize the application. And, finally, F11 takes an application full screen.

But when you are on that big screen, use Tactile with Super+T to bring up the tiling overview. Then press W+S 
to make the application take up the two center slots. You can also do Super+Q+Q to take up just the Q slot in 
the upper left slot. Or even Super+Q+S to take up the four slots on the left of the screen.

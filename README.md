Turn a fresh [Wayblue Sway](https://github.com/wayblueorg/wayblue) installation into my version of a fully-configured development system by running a single command.
`omakase-blue` is an opinionated take on an already opinionated Linux workstation.
Inspired by [Omakub](https://omakub.org/).

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://luke.hsiao.dev/omakase-blue.sh | sh
```

## Overview

These scripts install a set of useful GUI applications as Flatpaks, as well as a single distrobox dev container with all my favorite core tools.
This dev-toolbox is the default terminal experience, and shared access to `$HOME`, so it feels like you are working directly on the host.

## Known Issues

- you cannot run `omakaseblue` from within the toolbox (since we do not set up bash)
- uninstall and update paths are not well tested (e.g., we know uninstall does NOT uninstall everything we installed)

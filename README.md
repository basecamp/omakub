# BTR Omakub

This repo is based on the excellent [omakub.org](https://omakub.org) from 37signals, which turns "a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omakub. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best."

It has been customized to our needs in the BTR group. We have added applications that we need and reduced the customization a bit to have a more vanilla Gnome 3 experience.

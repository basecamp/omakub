Turn a fresh [Wayblue Sway](https://github.com/wayblueorg/wayblue) installation into my version of a fully-configured development system by running a single command.
`omakase-blue` is an opinionated take on an already opinionated Linux workstation.
Inspired by [Omakub](https://omakub.org/).

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://luke.hsiao.dev/omakase-blue.sh | sh
```

## Overview

These scripts install a set of useful GUI applications as Flatpaks, as well as a single distrobox dev container with all my favorite core tools.
This dev-toolbox is the default terminal experience, and shared access to `$HOME`, so it feels like you are working directly on the host.

## Installation

The easiest way to install wayblue sway right now is likely to install [Project Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) the normal way.
Then, follow the [Wayblue Sway instructions](https://github.com/wayblueorg/wayblue?tab=readme-ov-file#rebasing) to rebase your install on wayblue.

```
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/wayblueorg/$IMAGE_NAME:latest
systemctl reboot
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/wayblueorg/$IMAGE_NAME:latest
systemctl reboot
```

Then, currently due to the known issues, you need to first install two things:

```
ujust install-brew
rpm-ostree install fish
systemctl reboot
```

Then, you can run the script.

## Tailscale

If you want to use tailscale for ssh/mosh, you probable need to

```
sudo systemctl enable --now sshd
sudo firewall-cmd --add-interface=tailscale0 --zone=trusted --permanent
```

on the host.

## Known Issues

- homebrew is missing from the base image
- fish requires a reboot in the middle of the install
- you cannot run `omakaseblue` from within the toolbox (since we do not set up bash)
- uninstall and update paths are not well tested (e.g., we know uninstall does NOT uninstall everything we installed)

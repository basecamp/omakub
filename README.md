Turn a fresh [Project Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io/) installation into my version of a fully-configured development system by running a single command.
`omakase-bluefin` is an opinionated take on and already opinionated Linux workstation.
Inspired by [Omakub](https://omakub.org/).

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukehsiao/omakase-bluefin/main/entry.sh | sh
```

## Overview

These scripts install a set of useful GUI applications as Flatpaks, as well as a single distrobox dev container with all my favorite core tools.
This dev-toolbox is the default terminal experience, and shared access to `$HOME`, so it feels like you are working directly on the host.
